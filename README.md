 "The Effects of Male Involvement on Child Stunting Reduction in Sub-Saharan Africa:
Experimental Evidence in the Democratic Republic of Congo"

 ## 
 This is an experimental design proposal, aiming to reduce the rates of child stunted growth in the Democratic Republic of Congo, focusing on the Tshuapa Province. 
 

 ## Overview
 This project examines the impact of male involvement in nutritional training and cash transfers on child stunting reduction in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Stunting, a height-for-age z-score more than two standard deviations below the WHO Child Growth Standards, affects children’s physical and mental development. The study targets households in 174 villages in Tshuapa, targeting households with children under five and pregnant women. It proposes an intervention where men are included in nutritional training to assess whether increased awareness leads to better resource allocation for child nutrition. 
 
 It employs a Randomized Control Trial with 2 treated arms and one control. The first treated arm only targets pregnant women and children under five, getting training, therapeutic food and a $40 cash transfer. The second arm receives the same treatment, however, including one man at the household, which could be the woman's husband, father or brother, a male figure. Importantly, although men are included in the second arm, still only women receive cash transfers, this is to see how male behavior towards child nutrition would change given training only. Finally, the third arm is for control, and nothing will be done about it in order to observe the impact in the other arms.  
 
 The study hypothesizes that male inclusion will significantly decrease stunting rates by encouraging men to invest more in child nutrition. It utilizes household surveys for baseline, midline and endline data collection, aiming to provide insights into the effectiveness of male involvement in combating child stunting in the DRC.
